## 1. Opener (2 min)

"Hey [First Name], thanks for taking the time. Really appreciate it.

I'd love to hear about how [Business Name] handles online reviews today — what's working, what's not. Then I'll share what we're building and you can tell me if it's something you'd actually use. Sound good?"

*If they ask "what is Openly?" early:*
"Happy to explain — in short, it's review monitoring and response for local businesses at $29/mo with no contracts. But I'd rather understand your situation first so I can tell you honestly if it's even a fit."

---

## 2. Current State (5 min)

"So right now, how does [Business Name] handle Google and Yelp reviews?"

**Probe questions (use 2-3, not all):**
- "Are you using a tool for that, or managing it manually?"
- "How often do you check your reviews?"
- "Who on your team is responsible for responding?"
- "How long does it take you to respond to a review right now?"

**If they use Birdeye/Podium/competitor:**
- "How long have you been with them?"
- "What's your monthly cost with them?"
- "Are you on an annual contract?"

**If they manage manually:**
- "How much time per week does that take?"
- "Do you respond to every review or just the bad ones?"

---

## 3. Pain Points (5 min)

"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how you handle reviews, what would it be?"

**Probe questions (use 2-3):**
- "What frustrates you most about [their current tool/process]?"
- "Have you ever had a review slip through the cracks?"
- "Has a bad review ever cost you a customer that you know of?"
- "Have you looked at switching tools? What stopped you?"

**If they mention contracts/billing (our sweet spot):**
- "Tell me more about that. What happened?"
- "What would you do if you could cancel tomorrow?"
- "How much are you paying vs what you feel it's worth?"

**Listen for these gold phrases:**
- "I'm stuck in a contract" → strong buy signal
- "I'm paying too much" → strong buy signal
- "I don't have time to respond" → moderate signal
- "I don't really check reviews" → weak signal, probably not ICP

## 4. Budget & Decision (3 min)

"Thanks for sharing all that. Quick practical questions:"

- "What's your current monthly spend on reputation management?"
  - (If nothing: "What would you budget for this if the right tool existed?")
- "If you were going to switch tools, is that your call to make?"
- "Is this something you'd want to solve this month, or more of a 'someday' thing?"

---

## 5. The Openly Pitch (3 min)

"Based on what you've told me, here's what we're building and why I think it fits:

Openly is reputation management built on one principle: no traps.

We monitor your Google, Yelp, and Facebook reviews in one dashboard. When a review comes in, you get an instant notification. Our AI drafts a response — industry-specific, human-sounding — and you approve or edit it before it goes live. One click to post.

**What we don't do:** annual contracts, hidden fees, per-location pricing, 90-day cancellation notices, or any of the stuff that [Birdeye/Podium] is known for.

**Pricing:** $29/mo for founding members, locked in forever. Regular price will be $49/mo. No contracts — cancel anytime with one click."

*Pause. Let them react.*

---

## 6. The Close (2 min)

**If positive energy:**
"We're launching in [X weeks]. I'm saving 50 founding member spots at $29/mo — that price locks in forever.

Would [Business Name] want to be one of them? I can send you a link to hold your spot right now."

→ If YES: "I'll send the signup link after this call. Welcome aboard."
→ If MAYBE: "Totally fair. What would you need to see to feel confident?"
→ If "let me think about it": "Absolutely. What specifically are you weighing? I want to make sure you have the right info."

**If lukewarm:**
"Sounds like timing might not be perfect. What would have to change for this to be relevant for [Business Name]?"

**If no:**
"Appreciate the honesty. Out of curiosity — what would the ideal reputation management tool look like for you?"

---

## Two Critical Questions (Ask Before Hanging Up)

1. "What almost stopped you from taking this call?"
   → Reveals objections you didn't surface

2. "If Openly works as described, would you recommend it to another business owner?"
   → If yes, ask "Who? Can I reach out to them?"

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I'm locked in a contract" | "When does it expire? I'll set a reminder for you. In the meantime, join the waitlist to lock in $29/mo." |
| "$29 sounds too cheap" | "We don't have a 50-person sales team. No enterprise features you don't need. We pass those savings to you. If it doesn't work, you cancel in one click." |
| "What if you shut down?" | "Fair concern. Month-to-month means you're never trapped. If we're not delivering, you leave. That's the whole point." |
| "I need more features" | "Which ones specifically? If it's review monitoring, AI responses, and notifications — we've got that. If it's enterprise multi-location management — we're not the right fit yet, and I'd rather be honest about that." |
| "Let me think about it" | "Totally. What specifically are you weighing? I want to make sure you have the right info." |
| "Can I see a demo?" | "We're in early access — the product launches in [X weeks]. For now, here's exactly what you'd get: [walk through landing page features]. Would you want to lock in $29/mo now and get first access?" |
