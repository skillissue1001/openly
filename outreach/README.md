# Openly — Cold Outreach System

## Quick Start
1. Define your ICP (see `icp.md`)
2. Find prospects (see `prospect-sourcing.md`)
3. Send email sequence (see `email-sequences.md`)
4. Track replies in `../../.factory/memories/prospect-pipeline.md`
5. Book discovery calls (see `discovery-call-script.md`)
6. Track commitments in `../../.factory/memories/validation-log.md`

## Targets
- 200-500 outreach messages
- >50% open rate
- >2% positive reply rate
- 10-15 discovery calls
- 5+ pre-commitments at $29/mo

## Kill Criteria
If 500 messages + 10 calls = fewer than 5 willing to pay → pivot angle or market.
