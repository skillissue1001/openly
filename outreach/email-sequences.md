# Email Sequences — Openly

## Sequence A: "Trapped in a Contract" (Tier 1 — Angry Reviewers)

For prospects who left negative reviews of Birdeye/Podium on Trustpilot, BBB, or Reddit.

### Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)
**Subject:** Your Birdeye review caught my eye

Hi [First Name],

I saw your [Trustpilot/BBB] review about [Birdeye/Podium] — specifically about [their exact complaint, e.g., "the 90-day cancellation notice" / "being charged after trying to cancel"].

I'm building the opposite of that. It's called Openly — reputation management at $29/mo, no contracts, cancel with one click. We monitor and respond to your Google, Yelp, and Facebook reviews from one dashboard.

We're letting 50 businesses lock in that $29/mo price forever before we launch at $49/mo. Would you want to be one of them?

No sales call needed. Just reply here and I'll set you up.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Email 2: The Pain Reminder (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: Your Birdeye review caught my eye

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up — I keep finding more stories like yours. One business owner told me they lost $11,000 in a Birdeye contract they were never told about. Another spent 3 months trying to cancel Podium.

We built Openly specifically for business owners burned by this. No contracts. Published pricing. A cancel button that actually works.

If you're still stuck with [competitor], I'd love to save you a spot at our founding member price ($29/mo locked forever).

Worth a 10-minute chat?

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)
**Subject:** Re: Your Birdeye review caught my eye

Hi [First Name],

Quick update — [N] businesses have joined our early access waitlist this week.

The most common thing I hear: "I just want something that works without trapping me." If that resonates, I'd love to get you on our founding member list before we cap it.

Here's the landing page if you want to take a look: https://skillissue1001.github.io/openly/

Last follow-up from me. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all.

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 13)
**Subject:** Closing the loop on Openly

Hi [First Name],

Looks like the timing isn't right — totally understand.

One quick thing that might help: if you're stuck in a contract, most states allow cancellation within 3 business days of signing (FTC cooling-off rule) and many contracts have a clause buried in them for written cancellation. It's worth checking.

If you ever want to switch to something simpler, we'll be here at Openly.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Sequence B: "You're Overpaying" (Tier 2 — Active Users)

For businesses currently using Birdeye/Podium (spotted via Google Maps review responses).

### Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)
**Subject:** Quick question about your Google reviews

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Business Name] uses [Birdeye/Podium] to manage your Google reviews — I can see it in your review responses.

Honest question: are you happy with what you're paying? Most businesses I talk to are spending $300-600/mo for features they barely use.

I'm building Openly — same core review monitoring and AI response tools, but at $29/mo with no contracts. We only cover Google, Yelp, and Facebook, because that's what 90% of local businesses actually need.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to see if it makes sense for [Business Name]?

### Email 2: The Math (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your Google reviews

Hi [First Name],

Did some quick math — if [Business Name] is on a typical Birdeye plan, you're probably paying ~$300/mo or ~$3,600/year.

Openly does the same core job for $29/mo — that's $348/year. A difference of $3,252.

That's not a small number for a business your size. And there's no contract, so if we're not better, you cancel with one click.

### Email 3: Social Proof (Day 8)
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your Google reviews

Hi [First Name],

[N] local businesses have joined the Openly waitlist this week — most of them switching from Birdeye or Podium.

The common thread: they're tired of overpaying for features they don't use.

If that sounds familiar: https://skillissue1001.github.io/openly/

Last note from me.

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 13)
**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

Looks like timing isn't right for [Business Name]. Totally understand.

If your contract comes up for renewal and you want to explore alternatives, we'll be here. No pressure.

## Sequence C: "You Need This" (Tier 3 — No Tool Yet)

For businesses with 20+ reviews but no reputation management tool.

### Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)
**Subject:** 3 reviews on [Business Name]'s Google that need a response

Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Business Name]'s Google reviews and noticed a few recent ones that haven't been responded to — including [specific review detail, e.g., "a 2-star review from last week about wait times"].

Responding to reviews increases future rating by 0.12 stars on average (Harvard Business Review study). For a business with [N] reviews, that matters.

I'm building Openly — a simple tool that shows all your Google, Yelp, and Facebook reviews in one dashboard and uses AI to draft responses you can approve and post with one click. $29/mo, no contracts.

Would you be interested in being one of our first users?

### Email 2: Value Add (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: 3 reviews that need a response

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share something useful whether or not Openly is a fit:

3 quick wins for [Business Name]'s reviews:
1. Respond to your most recent 1-3 star review within 24 hours
2. Keep responses under 100 words — empathetic, not defensive
3. Mention the customer's specific concern by name

These alone can shift your response rate, which Google factors into local search ranking.

If you'd rather automate this: that's exactly what Openly does. Happy to show you.
