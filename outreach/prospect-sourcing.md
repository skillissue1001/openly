---

## Tier 1: Angry Reviewer Mining (Target: 50-100 prospects)

### Source 1: Trustpilot Reviews of Competitors
1. Go to trustpilot.com/review/birdeye.com (642 reviews)
2. Filter: 1-2 stars
3. For each reviewer:
   - Note their name and complaint
   - Search LinkedIn for "[Name] [industry keyword]"
   - Find their business and email
4. Repeat for trustpilot.com/review/podium.com (177 reviews)

### Source 2: BBB Complaints
1. Search BBB.org for "Birdeye Inc" (Palo Alto, CA)
2. Read complaint details — many include business names
3. Search for "Podium" and "Reputation.com Inc" (Redwood City, CA)
4. Cross-reference business names with Google Maps to find contact info

### Source 3: Reddit Threads
Search these queries:
- `site:reddit.com "birdeye" "cancel" OR "alternative" OR "scam" OR "trapped"`
- `site:reddit.com "podium" "contract" OR "cancel" OR "terrible"`
- `site:reddit.com "reputation management" "looking for" OR "alternative" OR "recommendations"`
- Subreddits: r/smallbusiness, r/dentistry, r/restaurateur, r/marketing, r/SEO

### Source 4: Google Searches
- "Birdeye alternative" → check who's asking
- "cancel Birdeye contract" → forums, blog comments
- "Podium reviews BBB" → find complainants
- "reputation management software reviews" → blog commenters

## Tier 2: Active User Identification (Target: 100-200 prospects)

### The Google Maps Method
This is the highest-signal prospecting method for Openly.

1. Open Google Maps
2. Search: "[business type] [city]" (e.g., "dentist Austin TX")
3. Click on a business with 50+ reviews
4. Read their review RESPONSES (not the reviews themselves)
5. Look for signatures like:
   - "Thank you for your feedback! — via Birdeye"
   - "Powered by Podium"
   - Response templates that look auto-generated
6. If they're using Birdeye/Podium → they're a prospect
7. Note: business name, owner name, phone, email (usually on Google Business Profile)

**Cities to mine (high SMB density):**
Austin, Nashville, Denver, Charlotte, Raleigh, Portland, Tampa, Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas

**Business types to search:**
Dentists, Chiropractors, Auto repair, HVAC, Plumbers, Restaurants, Hair salons, Law firms, Real estate agents, Veterinarians

**Target: 20 prospects per city x 10 cities = 200 prospects**

### LinkedIn Method
1. LinkedIn search: "Birdeye" in current experience → people who list Birdeye as a tool they use
2. Search "reputation management" + "local business" + job titles (Office Manager, Marketing Manager)
3. Use LinkedIn email finder tools (Hunter.io, Apollo.io free tier)

---

## Tier 3: No Tool Yet (Target: 50-100 prospects)

### The Unanswered Review Method
1. Google Maps → search business type in a city
2. Look for businesses with 30+ reviews but <50% response rate
3. Especially: businesses with recent 1-3 star reviews that went unanswered
4. These businesses NEED a tool but don't have one yet
5. Email angle: "I noticed 3 reviews on [Business Name] that need a response"

### Industry Directory Method
- ADA.org → Find a Dentist → local dentists with websites
- Yelp → high-review businesses without response patterns
- Google "best [business type] in [city]" → businesses on page 1 with review activity
