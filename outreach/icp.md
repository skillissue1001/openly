# Ideal Customer Profile — Openly

## Primary ICP: Local Business Owner / Marketing Manager

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Job Title** | Owner, Marketing Manager, Office Manager, General Manager |
| **Company Size** | 1-50 employees (SMB focus) |
| **Industry** | Dental, Medical, Auto Repair, Restaurants, Salons, Law Firms, Home Services, Real Estate |
| **Location** | US — any city |
| **Budget Signal** | Currently paying for Birdeye, Podium, Reputation.com, BrightLocal, or ReviewTrackers |
| **Pain Signal** | Left negative Trustpilot/BBB review, posted on Reddit about switching, tweeted about contract issues |
| **Monthly Spend** | $200-600/mo on current reputation tool |
| **Review Volume** | 10+ Google/Yelp reviews (enough to care about reputation) |

## Why This ICP

These businesses:
1. **Depend on reviews** — a 1-star drop = 5-9% revenue loss
2. **Are currently paying** — budget exists, no education needed
3. **Are trapped** — annual contracts they actively resent
4. **Are reachable** — public contact info, active on Google Business Profile
5. **Have low switching cost** — just need review monitoring + AI response, not enterprise features

## Disqualifiers (Skip These)
- Enterprise (200+ employees) — long sales cycles, procurement process
- Businesses with <5 reviews — don't care about reputation management yet
- Businesses not currently paying for a tool — need to educate, takes too long
- Agencies — different needs (multi-client, white-label), save for v2

## Prospect Tiers

### Tier 1: Hottest (Actively Complaining)
People who left 1-2 star reviews of Birdeye/Podium/Reputation.com on Trustpilot, G2, BBB, or Reddit. They're already frustrated and looking for alternatives.

**Where to find them:**
- Trustpilot reviews of birdeye.com (642 reviews, 3.6 rating)
- Trustpilot reviews of podium.com (177 reviews, 3.9 rating)
- BBB complaints for Birdeye Inc., Podium, Reputation.com
- Reddit threads: r/smallbusiness, r/dentistry, r/restaurateur, r/marketing
- Google "Birdeye alternative" or "cancel Birdeye contract"

### Tier 2: Warm (Using Competitors)
Businesses actively using Birdeye/Podium (visible in their review responses on Google). They may not be complaining yet but are susceptible to a better offer.

**Where to find them:**
- Google Maps → search business category → read review responses → if response says "via Birdeye" or "Powered by Podium" → that's a prospect
- G2 reviewer profiles (people who reviewed reputation management tools)
- LinkedIn: people with "Birdeye" or "Podium" in their tech stack

### Tier 3: Cold (Should Be Using a Tool)
Businesses with 20+ reviews but no review management tool. They're managing reviews manually and wasting time.

**Where to find them:**
- Google Maps → businesses with 50+ reviews but slow/no responses
- Yelp → businesses with unanswered reviews
- Industry directories (dental: ADA, auto: NADA, restaurants: local food blogs)
